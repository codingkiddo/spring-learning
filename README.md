# spring-learning



The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments




The Spring Framework is a mature, powerful and highly flexible framework focused on building web applications in Java.

One of the core benefits of Spring is that it takes care of most of the low-level aspects of building the application to allow us to actually focus on features and business logic.

Another strong point is that, while the framework is quite mature and well-established, it’s very actively maintained and has a thriving dev community. This makes it quite up to date and aligned with the Java ecosystem right now.

Of course, there’s a lot to learn to work well with Spring.

Let’s get started.




The Spring framework (shortly, Spring) is an application framework that is part of
the Java ecosystem. An application framework is a set of common software functionalities
that provides a foundation structure for developing an application. An application
framework eases the effort of writing an application by taking out the effort of
writing all the program code from scratch.



Both Spring and Spring Boot reference documentation is humongous and not beginner friendly.
